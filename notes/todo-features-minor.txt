AVATAR
  write run_tests(...) function that wraps all of this...
     save(delta, visible_files)
     output = test(max_duration)
     save_visible_files(...)
     save_traffic_lights(...)
  which currently happens in kata_controller
  It can parse output to determine traffic_light colour
  Might be able to reduce number of @variables in some controllers
  so the views reach into the domain objects...

DOWNLOAD
  reinstate download button on dashboard page.

SETUP-PAGE
  this can show a pre-allocated ID !
  ties it back to the home page nicely.
  [create] can go with the id
  [cancel] can be separated off to the right

DASHBOARD-FIRST-TRAFFIC-LIGHT
  in a refactoring dojo you want all the animals to be visible
  right from the start. They start from green. Perhaps show
  initial traffic-light only if its green?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DASHBOARD-DURATION
  the duration currently shows the time from the moment the
  dojo was created to the current moment. This could do with
  tweaking.
  Firstly, suppose you create a special setup (via forking)
  hours before it is needed. The duration time should start
  when the first animal presses [test].
  Also the duration end time should be calculated from the
  current time only if there has been a traffic-light
  within the last N minutes. If there hasn't, the duration end
  time should be the time of the last traffic light.
  This could be a good requirement to refactor the domain
  to include traffic-lights.

META-DASHBOARD
  have a page that allows you to enter the IDs of several dojos
  and these then look like filenames on the lhs. Clicking on
  one of them opens the dashboard for that id. This allows you
  to create a summary dashboard for codeRetreat style days.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DASHBOARD-TIME-GAP
  if there is a session that is split over several hours, eg
  if you resume a session one morning after starting it the
  previous session, it might be nice to be able to view
  one dashboard in two parts.

TEST-PAGE
  use dialog (to freeze editing) with big yin-yang spinner in center of
  page instead of small spinner to left of test button.
  Also, add words "Please wait while tests are run" to the dialog
  and do not tweak the output file. This will mean the display behind
  the dialog will stay on the file that was open when the test button
  is pressed.

ENTER
  add "pressing traffic-light..." message on enter-dialog

INITIALLY-RED-TESTS
  do this by using fail("") calls rather than deliberately wrong values.
  do this for all languages.

TEST-PAGE TRAFFIC-LIGHTS
  is the width of these still controlled by CSS?
  can just be the width of editarea+line-numbers?
  use px values to make sure they are exactly the same.
  then bulb-count numbers will align with line-numbers.

DIFF-REVERT-FORK DIALOG
  filenames do not appear in same way as on edit page.

  Get linenumber from cursor?

DIFF-DIALOG
  reclicking the filename to scroll to the next diff-chunk
  does not work (sometimes) for the 2nd+ clicks. Look at

DOCKER
  It would be a good idea if the setup screen/dialog
  indicated which Runner was being used, Docker or Raw.

EXERCISE=NONE

  which has empty instructions file.

UNTAR
  o) untar all files in downloads/ and zips/
  o) Do this off to the size of the main katas/ folder
     so that I avoid checking katas I've already checked.
  o) admin_scripts/find_old_language_names.rb will need refactoring
     so cyber-dojo-root-dir is a parameter.
  o) run admin_scripts/find_old_language_names.rb
  o) use info it generates to patch more language names.
  o) see if any katas are corrupt and are not worth saving.

C/C++ MAKEFILES
  improve them.
  ask for input from accu-general
  requirements
    - makes lib from non test src files
    - makes test exe from test src and lib

    - knows if makefile is changed

MODEL
  in app/lib/LinuxPaas.rb
  def make_kata_manifest(dojo, language, exercise, id, now)
    {
      :created => now,
      :id => id,

      :exercise => exercise.name,
      :unit_test_framework => language.unit_test_framework,
      :tab_size => language.tab_size
    }
  end
  Do I need to put :unit_test_framework and :tab_size
  into the kata's manifest? Why not retrieve them
  from the language? Is there a dependency on the
  language name? What if I rename a language?

EXERCISE-HAS-MANIFEST
  At the moment the instructions come from exercises/ and
  everything else comes from languages/ via manifest.rb
  This means if I want to create a special exercise with
  :highlight_filenames I have to do it as an exercise.
  And then I have to know to select it only with a specific language.
  How about allowing a language folder to have its own exercise folders.
  And give Exercise a manifest like Language?
