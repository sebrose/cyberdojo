Idea from Olve.
Only show the 7 (say) most popular languages
and exercises. Have buttons which you can press
which expand the selection if you want one of the
less popular languages.

Also related to this is the idea of removing Verbal
and having a dedicated button indicating that you
don't want to do a specific exercise, you'd just
like to code on your own for a while. This ties
in well with the timeout.

Could also split the create page into two pages.
First one is to select the language (with possible
pick one at random button). What to use the
spare screen estate for?
Second one is to select the exercise (again possible
pick one at random button).
And then have choice of whether to make dojo public
or private. Do this as two buttons which both cause
the dojo to be created.
Is there some way I could merge these three into one
page? How would I still be able to show the instructions
for the exercise?
Hmmm. How about when you hover over the [public] [private]
buttons the instructions screen is momentarily used to
display some info about what they do?
That's a simple hack that I think would work for now...
