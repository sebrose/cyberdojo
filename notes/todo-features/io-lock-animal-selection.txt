Do I need to do io_locks? Suppose there is a conflict. Could this
simply mean the git commit fails with a merge conflict? I think
not, since at the moment the avatar/sandbox folder is deleted
before each commit. But if a merge conflict could be created it
would open up the possibility of having multiple players all
playing as the same avatar. There could also be conflicts in the
sandbox where the tests are run. Perhaps that is the place to
check for conflicts?
