Invent special comment syntax/es that could be placed
in visible/invisible files.
The syntax would allow recording of helpfull URLs
eg c/c++/make references.
If these are detected then the are created as hyperlinks
in the test page. Perhaps below the file knave.
They could be "pinged" to see if they are still live.
Or maybe they could be accessible via a [useful links] popup.
