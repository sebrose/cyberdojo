4-DOJO-ROOMS-TO-LIMIT-CONCURRENT-USE
====================================

Thinking about how I could reduce the number of clicks to get started...
Suppose there were 4 rooms, each of a different colour.
Then players would not need to type in an ID. The room could have an ID
which they could use to get back to the session at a later time.
But at the start one person configures the blue room and then all the
players have to do is press the start button in the blue room.
Then they get a dialog saying "You are the panda". And you have to click
the ok button. Could I get rid of even that? Instead of a start button you
could have 16 animal buttons and you have to choose your animal by clicking it.
This also opens up the potential for not doing a setup, and then if you click
an animal, you get a random language+exercise combination.
The downside of this, of course, is that the blue room could be full when you
want to join it. But the upside is tremendous. You can see what people are
doing all the time without needing an ID.
I think this approach would definitely need each room to have a time-limit.
That way the room would become free again some time later.
Would mean the room-session could also have a name.
How about allowing a session to be either public or private.
If it's public then you can click a refresh button in your chosen room
(or ideally it appears all by itself) and a button for your session,
with its language,exercise,name,id is displayed. Click on it and you start.
This would also allow a history of previous sessions (by room perhaps).
Also, at the setup page, you could show all sessions that match the combination
you have chosen. And you could view those.
Or here's a possibly nice variation. Instead of public/private.
Have only public. But if you want you can delay (say by 1 hour) the public
appearance of the id.
Obviously a big design criteria for having private IDs is that it means
I don't really have to worry about 2+ computers using the same animal
at the same time. The resume feature means this is a definite possibility
if the ID is public.
