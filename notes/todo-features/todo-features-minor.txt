at bottom of dashboard page add tiny image of each animal
with a checkbox. If the box is checked that animal does
not appear on the main dashboard display. This solves two
problems (1) removing animals that you don't want displayed
eg they only have two lights and have been abandoned and
(2) during a review you can remove an animal from the display
after you have finished its individual review.

red/green/amber regexp pattern.

working towards a tag being created for inter-test events...
When an event happens in the browser I create a snapshot of
the current state. Eg if there are 3 files fileA,fileB,fileC,
then if you edit fileB, then edit fileC , then edit fileB again
you get three snapshots in the state array
  :originally state in browser matches state on server
    :state = [fileA-contentA,fileB-contentB,fileC-contentC]
  :event = edit fileB and open fileC
    :state = [fileB-contentB']
  :event = edit fileC and open fileA
    :state = [fileB-contentB',
              fileC-contentC']
  :event = edit fileB and press [test]
    :state = [fileB-contentB',
              fileC-contentC',
              fileC-contentB'']
    send that to server.

diff-dialog
  selection of most-changed-filename prefers to stay
  on the same file if there are no changes. Is this
  a good idea if the file is empty?
  Also, what if the selected filename is output?
  Should you prefer moving away from that?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
TEST-BUTTON
  Should there be a 15-second timeout on the browser too.
  Sometimes the red/green yin-yang spinner just hangs there.
  This could tie up nicely with replacing the auto form submission
  with custom state sent via custom ajax code.
  This raises a design issue. Suppose the browser times out
  and then a fraction of a second later the server completes.
  We now have a mismatch in server state and client state.
  One option is to retain the state array in the client
  and continue adding to it, and when a [test] happens again
  the state array contains two batches of edits which are sent.
  The server would then have to process the state array against
  the retrieved state and figure out that the first part had
  already been saved. Of course, a submission containing 2 [test]s
  worth of edits will have the server timeout of 15 seconds *per*
  test.
  Perhaps make the browser timeout slightly longer?

DIFF-DIALOG
  if the number of lines added/removed is reasonably large
  then when you click the added-delete-line-number button
  to toggle visibility there is no auto-scroll to bring
  added lines back into view.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
OUTPUT
  if the server times-out (15 seconds) is there any
  residual output? If there is it would be good to
  include it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
AGE
  if age >= 1 day then only display the number of days?
  Or the age ala git (eg "about 3 months")
  if age < 1 day then display hours, seconds, minutes

Once a kata has a max duration, I can move done katas
to a read-only server. Then I copy the support files
instead of linking them (at creation). This means I won't
need the link command on disk objects. I also won't need the
second -v volume mount in the DockerRunner.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
SCRIPT
  that counts number of diff'd lines in kata
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-DIALOG
  show the *time* between two tags
  [23] 00:54 [24]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
OUTPUT-PARSER
  it would be nice if I could stub this so that
  I could fully control scenarios involving traffic
  light colours. It would be easier than stubbing the
  output returned from test().

DASHBOARD-TIME-GAP
  if there is a session that is split over several hours, eg
  if you resume a session one morning after starting it the
  previous session, it might be nice to be able to view
  one dashboard in two parts.

DIFF-DIALOG
  have the diff-dialog as a dialog? If it was a regular page it would
  offer more consistency and also the goggle diagnostics would
  be able to give me better review stats.

KATA-EXPIRED
  have a timeout (1 day)
  when katas has expired
    o) no [revert]
    o) no [test]
  How? There is no heartbeat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
READ-ONLY SERVER
  o) need kata-expired
  o) needs GitRunner that is read-only
       no init,add,rm   [diff,show]
  o) needs OsDisk that is read-only
       no write,  [read,exists?]

SETUP-PAGE
  this can show a pre-allocated ID !
  ties it back to the home page nicely.
  [create] can go with the id
  [cancel] can be separated off to the right

DASHBOARD-FIRST-TRAFFIC-LIGHT
  in a refactoring dojo you want all the animals to be visible
  right from the start. They start from green. Perhaps show
  initial traffic-light only if its green?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
META-DASHBOARD
  have a page that allows you to enter the IDs of several dojos
  and these then look like filenames on the lhs. Clicking on
  one of them opens the dashboard for that id. This allows you
  to create a summary dashboard for codeRetreat style days.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
INITIALLY-RED-TESTS
  do this by using fail("") calls rather than deliberately wrong values?
  do this for all languages?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DIFF-REVERT-FORK DIALOG
  filenames do not appear in same way as on edit page.
  eg makefile and cyber-dojo.sh are not lo-lighted
  and are listed in different order.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
LINE-NUMBERS
  I'd like to highlight the current line-number
  as the cursor moves up and down in a textarea.
  Get linenumber from cursor?

JAVA
  add jMock
  add EasyMock
  add PowerMock with starting example of
    mocking a static method in static final class

DIFF-DIALOG
  reclicking the filename to scroll to the next diff-chunk
  does not work (sometimes) for the 2nd+ clicks. Look at
    http://manos.malihu.gr/page-scroll-to-id/
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
HOME-PAGE
  the small buttons on rhs no longer have the hover ghosting
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
DOCKER
  It would be a good idea if the setup screen/dialog
  indicated which Runner was being used, Docker or Raw.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
FILENAMES
  if there are lots of filenames make the scrollbar
  omit scrolling the output file.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
EXERCISE=NONE
  add exercise called none
  which has empty instructions file.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
UNTAR
  o) untar all files in downloads/ and zips/
  o) Do this off to the size of the main katas/ folder
     so that I avoid checking katas I've already checked.
  o) admin_scripts/find_old_language_names.rb will need refactoring
     so cyber-dojo-root-dir is a parameter.
  o) run admin_scripts/find_old_language_names.rb
  o) use info it generates to patch more language names.
  o) see if any katas are corrupt and are not worth saving.

C++ START FILES
  use a class?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  fill that area with images of animals and code that
  change every 30 seconds?

LANGUAGE-CHECKER
  test/installation red/amber/green testing is looking
  like its defunct. Excess detail. No need to keep it.

TOOL-TIPS
  have them open up in a popup right next to the item they are tipping.
  Look at how its done in jQuery book?
  Find plug-in.

MODEL
  in app/lib/LinuxPaas.rb
  def make_kata_manifest(dojo, language, exercise, id, now)
    {
      :created => now,
      :id => id,
      :language => language.name,
      :exercise => exercise.name,
      :unit_test_framework => language.unit_test_framework,
      :tab_size => language.tab_size
    }
  end
  Do I need to put :unit_test_framework and :tab_size
  into the kata's manifest? Why not retrieve them
  from the language? Is there a dependency on the
  language name? What if I rename a language?

EXERCISE-HAS-MANIFEST
  At the moment the instructions come from exercises/ and
  everything else comes from languages/ via manifest.rb
  This means if I want to create a special exercise with
  :highlight_filenames I have to do it as an exercise.
  And then I have to know to select it only with a specific language.
  How about allowing a language folder to have its own exercise folders.
  And give Exercise a manifest like Language?
