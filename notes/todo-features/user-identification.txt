user-identification
===================
  don't store the user's id. Store a hash of it.
  Allow a session to be tagged with a users hashed-id.
  No need to store any sensitive data.
  With this I can create a user-dashboard showing a history
  of previous dojos. This allows a comparison of dojo to dojo.
  This could be powerful in showing improvement.
