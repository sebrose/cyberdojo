cyberdojo/exercises/X folder could be beefed up to match
the cyberdojo/languages/X folder and has a manifest.json
file and can have visible_filenames.
It's entirely possible someone in education might want to
setup several specific start-point exercises for the same
language.
The problem with this though is that it would mean various
exercises being offered which were only appropriate for
a specific language. Perhaps allow each language to have
an exercises subfolder? At the moment the language manifest
specifies the bare bones source files for the code and test
file. These need to somehow be separated out so that they are
not included if a "custom" exercise is used.
How about having a language appear twice. Once as it currently
is with no exercises folder underneath the languages/*/ folder
and its manifest names and used the code and test files.
And again with an exercises/ folder underneath the
languages/*/ folder whose manifest does not name any code/test
files - they come from the custom exercises.
