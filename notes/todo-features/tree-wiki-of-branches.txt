hash-ids
========
  For the collection of files to see if there are duplicates...
  don't base the hash on files that are not relevant
  eg makefile, Makefile, cyber-dojo.sh
  Hmmm. It would also be useful to store hashes for
  individual files. It might well happen that although
  the combination of files has never been seen before
  one (or more) of the source files has occured before.
