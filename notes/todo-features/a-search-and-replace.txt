SEARCH-AND-REPLACE (15)
  button just below new/rename/delete
  opens dialog
  files?  defaults to current file, can enter regex if you want
    search-for: defaults to content selected in editor (or "")
  replace-with: defaults to content selected in editor (or "")
  both have dropdown history
  and [button]
  SED ?
  As you enter the search pattern the filenames listed
  are dynamically enabled/disabled (checkboxes). Or shown/not-shown?
  Show a count of how many matches the search-for regex has for each file
  And if you don't hit replace, then this gives you a way
  to search!
  Should the filenames displayed be all the files, or
  if highlighted files are marked, only the marked ones?
  Hmmmm. No, because the files the dev creates are bound to be
  the ones they want to search inside.
  Also, is output included in the filename list? No. Its readonly
  Also, is cyber-dojo.sh included in the filename list?
