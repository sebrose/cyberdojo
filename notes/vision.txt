Deliberate Practice
-------------------
I believe that the role of deliberate practice has huge untapped potential
in the field of professional software development. My particularly passion
is doing deliberate software practice in a collaborative way, both at the
pair level and at the team level. Hence cyber-dojo.
I work hard to *remove* features from cyber-dojo.
The simpler the environment the more players will concentrate on
the practice and the more they will need to collaborate with each other.
Remember the aim of a cyber-dojo is *not* to ship something!
The aim of cyber-dojo is to deliberately practice developing software
collaboratively.


Education
---------
Students could use cyber-dojo for exercises. Tutors could
then review their work not just based on a static snapshot of how
it ends up but also on the dynamic way it changed as it was worked on.
And possibly over several explicit repetitions.
